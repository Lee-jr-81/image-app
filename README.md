Minify Image Compressor

This project is a utility application that allows users to compresses large image files into smaller ones.
The app has been created by a team using Node JS, React and Vite.

Deployed using Netlify, this application is designed to enable users to select a file from their computer to upload before compressing the image using lossy compression (to ensure the maximum compression can be achieved). A download option then appears to the user to allow them to download the compressed image to their computer.

The repository for this application can be found at: https://github.com/Lee-jr-81/image-app

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
