## Using Minify

Deployed using Netlify, this application is designed to enable users to select a file from their computer to upload before compressing the image using lossy compression (to ensure the maximum compression can be achieved). A download option then appears to the user to allow them to download the compressed image to their computer.
The user interface is specifically designed to be simple and intuitive to use to give the user the best possible experience and get them returning to use Minify time and time again.
